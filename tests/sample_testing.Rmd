## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r message=FALSE}
library(CausalityExtraction)
library(dplyr)
```

# Inputs
```{r}
path_file_single <- "./../inst/extdata/sample_documents/jv04amj.pdf"

path_folder <- "./../inst/extdata/sample_documents/"

path_file_mult <- list.files(
  recursive  = FALSE, 
  path       = path_folder, 
  pattern    = ".pdf", 
  full.names = TRUE
  )
```

# Execute
## Single File
```{r}
df_1 <- CausalityExtraction(
  file_path = path_file_single
  )

df_1 %>% glimpse()
```

## Multiple Files
```{r}
df_2 <- CausalityExtraction(
  file_path = path_file_mult
  )

df_2 %>% glimpse()
```

## Folder
```{r}
df_3 <- CausalityExtraction(
  folder_path = path_folder
  )

df_3 %>% glimpse()
```
